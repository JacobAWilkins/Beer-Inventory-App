# Swift Scan Specifications
Project charter and Specifications for the Swift Scan project

### Project
**[Swift Scan](https://github.com/AlexMT96/BeerInventoryApp)** is an Android application that scans any barcode using your mobile device and keeps an inventory of your collections.

Most RFID reader kits are complicated and hard to use. This product is being developed to provide RFID reader capabilities to the common user. We want to allow collectors and small businesses to easily keep track of their items. In addition, we'd like to partner with different companies to allow their customers to easily obtain information about their products.
