The project consist of a single mobile application that can be used to keep an inventory of products. The app scans a bar-code and proceeds to look for the number in the internal database, if the product has already been registered then the app will present the available information to the user but in case that the product is not found in the database the app will allow the user to add the product to the inventory.

The app consist of 3 main components, the user interface, the internal database and the ZXing library. The app uses the ZXing library (Zebra Crossing) to read the bar-code and then proceeds to look into the internal database, the database is created when the app is launched for the first time and can be modified both in the app and in the internal phone memory (not recommended).
