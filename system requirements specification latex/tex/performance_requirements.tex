During the developmental stages of Swift Scan, the Android and Desktop apps will be tested for performance to make sure that information storage and retrieval are executed fast when the user interacts with the GUI.  The Android app, which will be used as a search engine for brewery products, will perform quickly to establish connection to the database and retrieve the product information for the beverage choice of the user.  On the other hand, the destop app will allow the user to easily manage the information that is stored in the database.  The goal of the desktop app is to make it feasible for the customer to use and navigate.  Since a barcode scanner will be used for the overall product, thorough testing and development will be done to make sure the barcode scanner does not consume repidly the smartphone's battery.
