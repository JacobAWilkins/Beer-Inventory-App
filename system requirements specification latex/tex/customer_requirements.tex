Swift Scan will include a variety of user features including a mobile interface, desktop interface, and access to product information on a multitude of alcoholic beverages.

\subsection{Mobile Application}
\subsubsection{Description}
The mobile interface will be an application for Android. It will include features for scanning products, creating a profile page, settings page, product page, and saved products list. These features will allow users to scan products and then save their items into a personal collection. From their phone, using the camera or other scanner, they will be able to easily scan products. The GUI will have a red (\#D11313) and white (\#FFFFFF) color scheme.

\subsubsection{Source}
The source of this requirement comes from the specified team member (Jacob Wilkins).

\subsubsection{Constraints}
Some constraints include making sure the user is 21 or over, making sure the cost to produce is under the \$800 budget, making sure the customer information is safe and secure, and making sure the content on the application is appropriate.

\subsubsection{Standards}
To keep user information safe, we will apply signature-based permissions and use implicit intents. In addition, we will disallow access to the app's content provider.

\subsubsection{Priority}
Critical

\subsection{Web Application}
\subsubsection{Description}
The desktop interface will have the same features as the mobile interface except for the ability to scan. All scans from the mobile application will be synced with the desktop version so that the user can seamlessly go back and forth between apps. The GUI will have a red (\#D11313) and white (\#FFFFFF) color scheme.
