The Beverage Invetory App (Swift Scan) will be available for download through GitHub for Android.  The GitHub link to download the Android app will be made available once the app has been fully tested and developed.  In addition, a desktop application will also be made available to download from GitHub and will need to be installed on a PC running Windows OS.  The desktop application will be an executable file so it can properly run on Windows OS.  The main purpose of the desktop application is for the user to have administrative privileges and access to adding, deleting, or modifying records from the central database that'll store all the information for any beverage.  Both the Android and desktop applications need to be both installed on an Android smartphone and Windows OS, respectively, in order for Swift Scan to function properly.  The RFID scanner device for the Android app will be packaged in a box with the name and logo of the application, Swift Scan.  An instruction manual will be included with the RFID scanner with information for both the Android and desktop applications.
