Our project is beer Inventory app, which mainly focus on beer arrangement, pricing and keeping track of items and their date etc.  We can test our Inventory app in the brewing lab where there is beer collection. Even we can test our inventory app in the store, hotel to arrange the beer, keeping track of sales and their expiry date. For testing ground, we will check our items in suitable lab which consist of beer collection that can be University, hotels or other places. For marker space it depends we can choose any spaces in University or we can do off Campus, but it should include all the elements (Beer) that we need. Yes, we require specific equipment; as our project is Beer Inventory app we need:
 Scanner
Android phone/Raspberry Pie
 Computer 
First, we will make sure if these items are available in the Lab or not and then we will talk to Prof. Chris Conly. After that what will figure out which will be suitable for us either to purchase or lease, and  we will go with the better option.
