The following list contains critical assumptions related to the implementation and testing of the project.

\begin{itemize}
  \item A secure database with a Linux operating system (OS) for storing information on each beverage as part of the inventory.  The most         suitable database would be using UTA's Omega database server.
  \item For secure communication between the application on an Android smartphone and the database server, a protocol will be esbablished         using port 443, or more commonly known as https.
  \item Access to different versions of Android OS to make sure that the functionality of the application will interact and function                correctly with the RFID scanner.
  \item The RFID scanner along with the SDK that comes with it should be able to scan any barcodes from beverages without the difficulty           of the user scanning any beverage barcode.
  \item Android smartphones should be compatible to fit with the RFID scanner of our choice so the smartphone does not fall or come apart         from the RFID scanner.
\end{itemize}
