The current problem is that our customer has no way to keep track of the inventory or we assume that the inventory is being kept in another form other than digital such as paper which is not a problem but as the production gets bigger makes it more difficult to keep track of the product. Beer that has been already produced needs to be labeled by the date it was produced so that it can be known when is the best time to drink it. As we know, the customer faces the problem of leaving the beer to age too long so they pass their prime time. Another problem being faced is the accommodation of the product, since the production of the beer is made in big quantities a lot of space must be made to accommodate all of it so if it is not accommodated with a system it gets easier to lose track of the oldest or most recent beer therefore taking us back to the previous problem. There are a few options on the market to manage inventory such as online applications, these tend to work very well but have some drawbacks, online inventory must be online at all times otherwise you have no access to the inventory, special bar code scanners must be bought to work with the online inventories because these connect to the internet to the online inventory and also these online inventories work on a memberships basis which in the long run are can cost a significant amount of money. There also exists desktop applications that can just be bought to manage inventories, these are the ones we find in small stores such as Dollar General, Walmart, SAM's Club and many other stores but most of them are targeted to big and more general inventories so they don't really work very well with this kind of small inventory. Another problem for inventory software is that it tends to be very expensive plus some type of bar-code scanner that are also very expensive and for a small inventory like this one of these software would be too much to invest on. The current customer wants a more practicable way to keep track of the inventory without having to spend too much money and easy to use, preferable something that can be done with the help of a smart phone or tablet.to be able to manage the inventory at an inexpensive solution, something that can be easily done with the help of a smart phone,
