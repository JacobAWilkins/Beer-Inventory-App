Upon completion of the prototype system, we expect the following success indicators to be observed with clients using our new inventory system:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A 15\% reduction in inventory costs
  \item 20\% reduction in average scanning time
  \item 10\% expansion of the RFID scanning market
\end{itemize}

Within 6 months after the prototype delivery date, we expect the following success indicators to be observed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item An additional 10\% reduction in inventory costs
  \item An additional 10\% reduction in average scanning time
  \item An additional 5\% expansion of the RFID scanning market
  \item Porting the system to iPhone
\end{itemize}

Within 12 months after the prototype delivery date, we expect the following success indicators to be observed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Expansion of the system to 3 additional deployment sites
  \item Porting of the system to additional mobile platforms
  \item An additional 10\% reduction in inventory costs
\end{itemize}
